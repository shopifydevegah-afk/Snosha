# Shosha – Project Plan (permanent)
> Single source of truth for project decisions & progress. Rules: figma-to-sections-workflow skill → references/project-plan-template.md. Update incrementally; never recreate.

## A. Project overview

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Project / brand | Shosha / SNOSHA |
| Platform / theme | Shopify, Horizon 4.4.0 (blocks-first) |
| Language / direction | Arabic / RTL. Font: Cairo (`assets/custom-cairo.css.liquid`) |
| Target templates | `templates/index.json` (homepage). Global: `sections/header-group.json`, `sections/footer-group.json` |
| Figma file | https://www.figma.com/design/1fqyznLFgS65tTjGvBYPBm/Snosha |
| Desktop homepage | `190:3767`, https://www.figma.com/design/1fqyznLFgS65tTjGvBYPBm/Snosha?node-id=190-3767 (1480px wide) |
| Mobile homepage | `190:4082`, https://www.figma.com/design/1fqyznLFgS65tTjGvBYPBm/Snosha?node-id=190-4082 (390px wide) |
| Environment | Claude Code in the theme repo. Shopify CLI 4.9.4 (`shopify theme dev` for preview). Git; no auto commit/push/deploy |
| Delivery | Incremental: one section at a time, after the user's request with its nodes |
| Current homepage state | `index.json` has only `product-list` (`product_list_fa6P9H`), **disabled** (verified 2026-11-08) |

## B. Global architecture decisions

Each one is decided; the details are in the referenced Skill file.

| # | Decision | Governing reference |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Native-first, reuse ladder A–E. A new section (E) needs justification and the user's approval | SKILL.md |
| B2 | Horizon blocks-first composition; no duplicate components or layout systems | horizon-architecture.md, native-component-registry.md |
| B3 | `custom_class` on demand, only on sections/blocks being customized. Preferred names `sn-<page>-<section>[-<part>]` | custom-class-policy.md |
| B4 | All Figma CSS scoped to the custom class, in the owner's developer file | custom-class-policy.md §5 |
| B5 | Three-level reversibility, with the result recorded per section in F | custom-class-policy.md §6 |
| B6 | Content media editable in the Theme Editor; native settings first; merchant uploads final files | schema-extension-policy.md "Media settings" |
| B7 | Use Horizon tokens and theme settings first. Exact Figma values go in class scope. Global type/color changes need approval (see G) | horizon-architecture.md |
| B8 | Breakpoints: ≤749 / 750–989 / ≥990 / ≥1440 when needed. Arabic RTL with logical properties | horizon-architecture.md |
| B9 | VERIFIED needs: Theme Check at baseline, plus desktop/mobile/RTL visual QA and the two-state test, with evidence | figma-analysis-and-qa.md |

## C. Developer ownership

| Developer | CSS file | Status | Sections assigned |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main | `assets/main.css` | Initialized 2026-11-08 (loaded once after `custom-cairo.css`) | none assigned explicitly yet |
| Dev1 | `assets/dev1.css` | Not initialized | — |
| Dev2 | `assets/dev2.css` | Not initialized | — |
| Dev3 | `assets/dev3.css` | Not initialized | — |

**Custom classes owned:** none yet.
**Shared-file claims (active):** none.

## D. Section registry

Logical areas from the Figma homepage, in Figma order. A row isn't necessarily one Shopify section file. Nodes were verified with `get_metadata` on 2026-11-08.

| ID | Section | Desktop node | Mobile node | Target | Owner | Status | Cat. | Native component | Custom class | Dependencies / blockers |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S01 | Announcement Bar | `190:3768` | `190:4083` | header-group (global) | — | NOT_STARTED | — | — | — | Global: affects all pages |
| S02 | Header / Navigation | `190:3769` + `190:3776` | `190:4084` | header-group (global) | — | NOT_STARTED | — | — | — | Global. `header` already has 42 settings (G) |

## E. Section decisions

None yet. Each section gets its own subsection here (with the Native Reuse Audit) when its task starts.

## F. QA & progress

| ID | Figma analysis | Code checks | Visual desktop | Visual mobile | RTL | Media | Reversibility | Pending issues |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S01–S15 | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | Only project-level mapping done; no section-level analysis yet |

Give a section its own row here when its work starts, and keep the S01–S15 row only for sections that haven't started.

## G. Global risks & dependencies

**Confirmed facts (2026-11-08):**
- Container: Figma's desktop content is 1376px inside a 1480px frame (52px margins). Horizon has 40px desktop margins and a 120rem (1920px) "normal" page width, so at 1480px the content is 1400px.
- Gutters: Figma mobile 24px (20px in some sections) vs Horizon 16px. Horizon scales padding ×0.7 below 990px.
- Tokens: Cairo, `#176bb0` (primary button), `#f0fafe` and `#dcf2fb` (palette) match. The theme foreground is `#000000` vs Figma `#131311`, and theme H1/H2 are 56/48px vs Figma display 56, H1 40, H2 32.
- Theme Check baseline: 9 offenses (2 errors, 7 warnings), listed in horizon-architecture.md.
- The `header` schema has 42 settings (Theme Check warning; not a platform limit).
- Media: the merchant uploads final images and videos through the Theme Editor. No Figma exports go in the code.
- Preview: Shopify CLI preview is available but hasn't been used for visual QA yet.

**Pending decisions (need the user):**
- P1: Container/gutter strategy, either per section (class-scoped) or a global change (protected setting).
- P2: Global typography and color alignment (foreground color, heading sizes), either global settings (needs approval) or class-scoped per section.
